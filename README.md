## Scality Test

The names of files or folders contains the ressponse to the question asked.
The `assets` folder only contains files that needs  to be read by some of the question (1 and 5).

Question 2 and 3 are in the same folder since it was answered at the same time when writing the API. 

## Go furthur
Since it was only a small test, I didn't include much documentation (especially for the API ), tests, and environment variables configuration.
Moreover, it is also not following standard practice for code versionning using git, since most of the code was written in a short amount of time and in parralel.
